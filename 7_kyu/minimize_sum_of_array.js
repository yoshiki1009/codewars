/* Task
Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .

Notes
Array/list will contain positives only .
Array/list will always has even size
Input >> Output Examples
minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22)
Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product , 5*2 + 3*4 = 22
minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) ==> return (342) */

const minSum = arr =>
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b).reduce((pre, val) => pre + val * arr.pop(), 0);
